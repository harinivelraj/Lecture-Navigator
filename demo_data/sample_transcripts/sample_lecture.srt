00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to the intro to machine learning.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:15,000
In this lecture we will discuss supervised learning, regression, and classification.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Regression predicts continuous values. Classification predicts discrete labels.

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:01:00,000
We will cover loss functions, gradient descent, and evaluation metrics like accuracy and MRR.
